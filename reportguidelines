Technical Report Writing: Topics, Types and Structure
What is a technical report?
A technical report is a formal document that details an investigation or project and its outcomes. It records the research process, including phases, methods, results and peculiarities, and often includes experimental data and supporting visuals
clickhelp.com
. Technical reports are used widely by educational institutions, government bodies and private companies as a basis for decision‑making
clickhelp.com
. A high‑quality report should be clear, concise and structured logically so that different readers can access the level of detail they need
clickhelp.com
.
General structure and template
A typical technical report follows a predictable sequence so that readers can easily navigate the document. The University of Sussex guide notes that formal reports usually include a title page, summary (abstract/executive summary), contents, introduction, body sections, conclusions, references, bibliography, acknowledgements and appendices
sussex.ac.uk
. The St. Louis University writing centre further subdivides the document into front matter, body and back matter and explains what goes into each section
slu.edu
.
slu.edu
. Below is a consolidated template derived from these sources:
Section
Purpose / contents (brief)
Notes
Title page
Title of report, names of preparers and readers, date, organisation/affiliation
slu.edu
Should be precise and informative
sussex.ac.uk
.
Abstract / executive summary
A 150–300‑word summary of the document’s purpose and main findings
slu.edu
. Executive summaries highlight cost/time implications for decision‑makers
slu.edu
.
Write this after finishing the report.
Table of contents
Lists section and subsection headings with page numbers
slu.edu
.
Includes lists of figures or tables if necessary.
Introduction
States the objectives, background and scope. It leads readers into the report and justifies why the work is important
sussex.ac.uk
. For scientific reports, start with the broad problem, provide context, identify gaps in existing literature and end with your research question/hypothesis
miamioh.edu
.
Should not replicate instructions or background from a lab hand‑out
sussex.ac.uk
.
Methods / Procedures
Describes how the work was conducted: materials used, research design, data‑collection methods and analytical techniques
slu.edu
. The methods must be detailed enough to allow replication
miamioh.edu
.
Use bullet lists for clarity when appropriate
slu.edu
.
Results / Findings
Presents a neutral account of the data and observations without interpretation
slu.edu
. Organise findings logically, highlight important trends and reference tables/figures
miamioh.edu
.
Often the longest section in research reports
slu.edu
.
Discussion / Analysis
Interprets the results, explains why they occurred, compares them with previous work and discusses implications
miamioh.edu
.
Avoid speculation unsupported by data; connect findings back to objectives and hypotheses.
Conclusions
Summarises the main points and logical outcomes. It should directly answer the objectives posed in the introduction
sussex.ac.uk
.
Keep concise.
Recommendations (if relevant)
Suggests actions or decisions based on the conclusions
slu.edu
.
Use bullet points for clarity.
References/Bibliography
Lists sources cited and additional reading
sussex.ac.uk
. Cite all quotations, paraphrases and summarised material
slu.edu
.
Follow an appropriate citation style (APA, IEEE, etc.).
Glossary
Defines technical terms unfamiliar to readers
slu.edu
.
Optional but useful for non‑expert audiences.
Appendices
Provide raw data, large tables, calculations, diagrams or code that would interrupt flow in the body
sussex.ac.uk
slu.edu
.
Label sequentially (Appendix A, B, …).

Major sections in scientific/technical reports
For research‑driven reports (lab reports, scientific investigations), the body often follows the IMRD pattern: Introduction, Methods, Results and Discussion. The Howe Writing Center at Miami University gives detailed guidance:
Introduction – justify the importance of the study, provide relevant background, identify gaps in knowledge and end with the research question or hypothesis
miamioh.edu
. Avoid including extraneous details or failing to persuade readers that the study is warranted
miamioh.edu
.
Methods – describe how the research question was addressed, including materials, participants, procedures, measurements and statistical techniques
miamioh.edu
. Omit unnecessary details and organise this section logically
miamioh.edu
.
Results – provide an objective summary of findings, emphasising patterns and trends without interpretation. Use topic sentences to introduce data descriptions and refer to tables and figures where appropriate
miamioh.edu
.
miamioh.edu
.
Discussion – interpret and explain the results, relate them back to hypotheses, compare with other studies, discuss limitations, suggest improvements or future research and address broader implications
miamioh.edu
.
Types of technical reports
Different report types serve distinct purposes. The Committee on Scientific and Technical Information (COSATI) identified eight main types of technical reports
libguides.rutgers.edu
. Expanded classifications incorporate additional specialised documents
libguides.rutgers.edu
. Key categories include:

When selecting a topic, ensure that the report has a clear purpose (to inform, analyse or recommend), a defined audience and available data. Also determine whether the report will need regulatory compliance (e.g., environmental impact statement) or proprietary confidentiality (e.g., corporate proposals).
Tips for effective technical report writing
Know your audience – Identify the readers and tailor the level of technical detail accordingly. Write for the reader, not for yourself
clickhelp.com
.
Plan before writing – Collect information, organise it logically and outline the report structure
sussex.ac.uk
. Keep accurate records of sources to facilitate referencing
sussex.ac.uk
.
Use clear, precise language – Avoid jargon unless it is defined; include a glossary when necessary
slu.edu
.
Employ visuals – Diagrams, tables and charts can make complex information easier to digest
clickhelp.com
.
Edit and proofread – Revise drafts for logical flow, accuracy and conciseness. Proofreading eliminates technical and language errors
clickhelp.com
.
Follow instructions – When a report is for a course or client, always follow the specific guidelines provided, even if they differ from generic templates
miamioh.edu
.
Conclusion
Technical reports are essential for documenting research, analysing options and supporting decision‑making. They follow a consistent structure—front matter, body and back matter—which guides readers from purpose and context through methods, results and conclusions. Different types of reports (feasibility, progress, specification, research, recommendation, etc.) serve different needs and audiences. Selecting a topic that aligns with organisational goals and following a clear, logical template will help ensure that your report is informative, persuasive and professional.
